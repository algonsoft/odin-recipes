    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
      <li>1 large onion, sliced</li>
      <li>4 eggs</li>
      <li>4 slices Canadian bacon</li>
      <li>4 pineapple rings</li>
      <li>4 slices cheddar cheese</li>
      <li>1 (8.25 ounce) can sliced beets, drained</li>
      <li>4 slices tomato</li>
      <li>4 lettuce leaves</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon ketchup</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon yellow mustard</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons dill pickle relish</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons mayonnaise</li>
      <li>4 Kaiser rolls, split</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat.</li>
      <li>When the grill is ready, lightly oil the grilling 
        surface. Form the ground beef into four patties, and 
        grill for 5 minutes per side, or until cooked 
        through.</li>
      <li>Meanwhile, melt butter in a large skillet over medium 
        heat. Add onions, and fry until soft. Remove the onions 
        from the skillet, and crack the eggs in the same skillet
         over medium heat. Cook until the yolks are solid, 
         turning over once. Remove eggs, and set aside. Place 
         the Canadian bacon in the same skillet, and fry until 
         toasted. Remove the bacon, and turn the heat to high. 
         Quickly fry the pineapple rings in the bacon drippings 
         just until browned on each side.</li>
      <li>To Assemble sandwiches: Set bottom of kaiser roll on a 
        plate, and top with burger, a slice of cheese, a slice 
        of Canadian bacon, one fried egg, fried onions, a few 
        slices of beet, a slice of pineapple, a slice of tomato, 
        and a leaf of lettuce. Decorate the top bun with ketchup,
         mustard, relish and mayonnaise as desired. Place over
          the burger. Repeat with remaining burgers.</li>
    </ol>
